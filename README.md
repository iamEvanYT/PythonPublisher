PythonPublisher is a Python script for automating the process of publishing Roblox places. It allows you to schedule the publish at a specific time, replace servers, and optionally restart servers if you provide a Roblox cookie. The script also provides flexibility by allowing configuration through environment variables or direct input.

Version 2 introduced a web panel to help schedule updates!
